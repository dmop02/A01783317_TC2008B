## Exercises:
1. Give a recursive definition of the set of strings over $\{a,
b\} $ that
contain at least one $b$ and have an even number of $a$ i
2i\
_**SOLUTION:**_

4. Let $L$ be the set of strings over $\{a, b\}$ generated by the
recursive
definition
**I. Basis:** $b \in L$


**II. Recursive Step**: If $u \in L$ then $ub \in L$, $uab \in
L$, $uba \in
L$ and $bua \in L$


**III. Closure**: A string $u \in L$ only if it can be
obtained from the
basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive
step.


**a.** List the elements in the sets $L_0, L_1, L_2$


**b.** Is the string $bbaaba$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is
produced.
If not, explain why not.


**c.** Is the string $bbaaaabb$ in $L$? If so, trace how it is
produced.
If not, explain why not



5. Prove, using induction on the length of a string, that $
(w^R)^R = w$ for all
string $w \in \Sigma$


_**SOLUTION:**_

Assuming that the statement is true for all strings of length less than "n", and considering a string w of length n. We can write "w" as "x a", where x is a string of length "n-1" and a is the last character of w.

Using this string reversal, we have $w^R = a x^R$

Therefore, $(w^R)^R = (a x^R)^R = x a^R$

we have $x^R = x$ and $a^R = a$

Using induction, the statement $(w^R)^R = w(w^R)^R = w$ is true for all strings $w \in \Sigma$



 Base: $\lambda \in$ L
 
 Recursive Step: if u $\in$ L then aub, $aub^2$ $\in$ L
  
  Closure: A string u $\in$ L only if it can be obtained from the basis using a finite number of applications of the recursive step.
